# converter-app-that-performs-three-conversions


Converter app that performs three conversions. First: change Celsius to Fahrenheit. Second: change kilograms to pounds. And third: change feet to centimeters.

Using JavaScript functions I created this app. The function call is to a single function called converter(), in which you pass the parameters of Celsius, Kilograms and feet. This function internally calls three helper functions to convert these things and log it and All three helper functions are of different types: one is a "function declaration" and the other a "function expression", and the last an "arrow function".
